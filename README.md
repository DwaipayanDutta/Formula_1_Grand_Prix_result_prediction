# 🏁 F1 Grand Prix Result Prediction

Welcome to the **Formula 1 Grand Prix Result Prediction** project! This repository is designed to predict the winners of upcoming F1 races based on historical data of **drivers**, **constructors**, or a **combination of both**. With machine learning at its core, this project brings together data science and motorsport to explore what it takes to win in Formula 1.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling historical Formula 1 data to forecast future race outcomes. Using various performance indicators from past races, the model aims to predict which driver or constructor is most likely to win the next Grand Prix.

## 📊 Data Sources

The data for this project is located in the [`Data_Files`](https://github.com/DwaipayanDutta/Formula_1_Grand_Prix_result_prediction/tree/main/Data_Files) directory and includes:

- `drivers.csv` — Information about F1 drivers
- `constructors.csv` — Details about constructor teams
- `races.csv` — Historical race information
- `results.csv` — Race results and outcomes
- `qualifying.csv` — Qualifying stats
- `pit_stops.csv` — Pit stop details
- `lap_times.csv` — Lap-by-lap timing data
- `status.csv` — Final race status for drivers

These datasets form the foundation for feature engineering and model training.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Goals

We aim to build predictive models that can:

- Predict the **race winner** based on driver statistics
- Predict based on **constructor/team** performance
- Combine both sets of features for a **hybrid approach**
- Analyze **feature importance** to see what most influences race outcomes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy — Data manipulation
- Scikit-learn — Machine learning models
- Matplotlib, Seaborn — Visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks — Interactive analysis

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Before diving into model training, we perform thorough EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and potential biases in the dataset. Visualization tools are used to understand win rates, constructor dominance, and driver consistency.

## 🧪 Model Training

Multiple ML algorithms are tested including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines

We evaluate them based on **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall**, and tune them using grid search and cross-validation.

## 📈 Prediction Output

The final model outputs predictions for upcoming Grand Prix events and highlights the most probable winners. It also provides confidence scores and feature impact breakdowns.
